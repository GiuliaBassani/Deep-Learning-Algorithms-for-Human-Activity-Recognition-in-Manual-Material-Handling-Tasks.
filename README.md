# Deep-Learning-Algorithms-for-Human-Activity-Recognition-in-Manual-Material-Handling-Tasks.

The MATLAB scripts in this repository can be used to train the networks presented in the paper "Deep Learning Algorithms for Human Activity Recognition in Manual Material Handling Tasks.".

  BiLSTM.m to train the Vanilla BiLSTM;
  SpDAE.m to train the Sparse Denoising Autoencoder;
  RecurrentSpDAE.m to train the Recurrent Sparse Denoising Autoencoder;
  RCNN.m to train the Recurrent CNN;
  BiLSTM_LOSO.m to test the BiLSTM with LOSO validation method;
  RCNN_LOSO.m to test the RCNN with LOSO validation method.

The input data, extracted from the publicly available dataset at this link https://zenodo.org/records/4633087, can be downloaded from the OneDrive folder reported in the scripts.
